# Get In Touch With Me

I cover cybersecurity, national security, election security, technology, and data for [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/). If you have something you think I should take a look at please don't hesitate to let me know. Each method of contact carries its own complications and level of anonymity. Please consider your risk level when reaching out. For instance, if sending sensitive materials your employer would not approve you sending, please don't use your work computer or phone.

## Email

You can email me directly at any time at **avicens [at] motherjones [dot] com**. Keep in mind that standard email records [a lot of information](https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204643950/understanding-an-email-header) about you and me (sender/receiver, time sent, from where, operating systems, etc.) In some cases the content of the email itself could be plainly visible to someone with the wherewithal to look for these sorts of things. If that's OK with you, go ahead and send me that email.

You can also find me at ProtonMail, which offers end-to-end encryption *between ProtonMail users* for free: `aj_vicens@prontonmail.com`
